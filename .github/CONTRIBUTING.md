## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. **Create a new branch** for your work:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
````

3. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests).
4. **Commit** your changes with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
   ```

   > Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) when possible (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the main repository.

## 💻 Code Style

* Follow consistent **naming conventions** (`camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes, etc.).
* Write **clear, descriptive commit messages**.
* Include **comments** where logic is complex.
* Keep functions and files **small and focused**.
* Run **linters/formatters** if available (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).

---

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

* Use the **issue templates** provided in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
* Clearly describe the problem: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior.
* Include screenshots, logs, or sample code when relevant.

---

## 🔀 Pull Requests

* Reference related issues in the PR description (`Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`).
* Ensure **all tests pass** before submitting.
* Add or update **tests** if your changes introduce new logic.
* Keep PRs **focused and small**; large PRs are harder to review.
* Be respectful and constructive during code reviews.

---

## ✅ Getting Help

* Check [existing issues](../../issues) before opening a new one.
* Start a [discussion](../../discussions) for questions or ideas.
* Reach out to maintainers if unsure about contribution scope.
